# Project 1

### This is an example project, used for demonstration purposes. 

This program creates a simple Caesar Cipher. I wrote this project because my kids have a toy that has a set of cipher codes. They wanted to code their own messages and decipher them, so I wrote this program to take a message and spit out an encoded message that they would trade and decipher. 

To run this program, make sure that Python3 is installed and working. You can validate this by running in your command prompt on Windows or Linux:

If using Windows, type:
```powershell
python --version
```

If using Linux, you may need to specify Python3
```bash
python3 --version
```

Now, from the project1 folder that contains encoder-ring.py, run the program using Python

```bash
python3 encoder-ring.py
```

Example Output: 
```bash
$ python3 encoder-ring.py
Enter secret message (letters and spaces only, please)
Hello this is my secret message
SVOOL GSRH RH NB HVXIVG NVHHZTV
```
Now send this message to a friend and have them decode your secret message!
